# Sensor-Project
#Project Topic Requirements:

The final project has to fulfill the following requirements:

- At least two Nucleo boards have to communicate within a network. Suitable communication interfaces can be implemented by using Clicks from our list with a mark in their COMM column (alternatives such as using I2C of jumper wires between Nucleo boards should be discussed with you lecturer first).
- The applications that are used on the Nucleo boards have to run within a FreeRTOS environment.
- You have to capture data from peripherals like (temperature/humidity sensors, ultra-sonic distance sensors etc.) and interface actuators (stepper-motors, relays,...) or displays (OLED click modules,...) with your Nucleo boards
- The Nucleo boards must display the current status of the system or provide other means of user interaction apart from the on-board hardware.
- For example, they can communicate with a central server (e.g., a Raspberry Pi running Linux), provide some API to a (very!) simple mobile app, or implement a web server on their own.
- You are allowed to use foreign libraries for these parts of your project.
- Please use BOTH provided micro USB cables to power the Nucleo + Click-Shield board. Not doing so can result in unexpected behavior.
